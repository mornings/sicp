        <p class="blockquote"><strong>Wizard Book</strong> n. — Hal Abelson's, Jerry Sussman's and Julie Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (MIT Press, 1984; ISBN 0-262-01077-1), an excellent computer science text used in introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the jacket. One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the Purple Book.</p>

        <!-- Reason for Being -->
        <p><span>This site is a companion to the influential computer-science text <strong>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong>, by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. Its purpose is to demonstrate the Web's potential to be a channel for innovative support for textbook users.</span></p>
        <p><span>The material on this site is aimed at instructors using SICP as a course text, and at people using the book for self-study.</span></p>

          <li><a href="#">How to get Scheme</a>
          <p>SICP uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Scheme implementations are available for most common platforms. From MIT, we supply free implementations of the MIT Scheme programming environment. This page provides information on how to obtain copies of MIT Scheme as well as other implementations.</p></li>
          
          <li><a href="#">A note on our course at MIT</a>
          <p>This note describes the organization of our course as MIT, as well as an overview of the educational approach underlying the course and SICP. There is also a sample syllabus for the course.</p></li>
          
          <li><a href="/schools.html">Schools using SICP</a>
          <p>A partial and growing list of universities and colleges that are using SICP for either an introductory or an advanced course.</p></li>
